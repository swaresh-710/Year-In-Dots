# Year in Dots 📅

**Visualizing the year, one dot at a time.**

![Year in Dots Preview](./icon.png)

A minimalist "Life Calendar" for your browser's New Tab page. It displays the 365 days of the year as a grid of dots:
*   ⚪ **Past days** are completed.
*   🟠 **Today** is highlighted (orange, blinking, or hourglass).
*   ⚫ **Future days** are waiting to be lived.

## ✨ Features

*   **Live Progress**: See exactly how much of the year has passed (e.g., "54% Completed").
*   **Customizable "Today"**: Choose between a static Orange Dot, Blinking Red, or a Spinning Hourglass.
*   **Zero Distractions**: Clean, dark-mode design to keep you focused.
*   **Local Privacy**: All settings are saved directly in your browser.
